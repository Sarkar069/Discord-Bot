This bot is developed using the [Disnake](https://guide.disnake.dev/) library, a modern, easy-to-use, feature-rich, and async-ready API wrapper for Discord.


Creating a Discord bot involves several steps. Here is a detailed process to create a Discord bot:

### Step 1: Create a Discord Account and Server
**Create a Discord Account**: If you don't already have a Discord account, create one by downloading and installing the Discord application from the official website.\
Create a Server: Create a server by clicking on the "+" icon in the bottom left corner of the Discord application and selecting "Create a Server." Choose a name and icon for your server.
### Step 2: Create a Discord Application
**Access the Developer Portal**: Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) into your browser.\
**Create a New Application**: Click on the "New Application" button.\
**Name the Application**: Fill in the details of your app (name, etc.) and proceed to the app's dashboard.\
**Switch to Bot Mode**: Look up "Bot" on the settings list and click "Add Bot" to switch your app to bot mode.
### Step 3: Create a Bot
**Reset Token**: Select the "Reset Token" option and confirm by clicking "Yes, do it!".\
**Copy the Bot Token**: The bot token is your bot's password. Copy the token to the clipboard and paste it into your .env.
### Step 4: Invite the Bot to a Server
**OAuth2 Tab**: Switch to the "OAuth2" tab.\
**Set Permissions**: Set the app's scope to "bot" and choose the permissions you want for the bot.\
